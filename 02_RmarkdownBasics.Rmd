# Rmarkdown Basics

**Learning Objectives**

After completing this tutorial you should

* understand the value of using Rmarkdown files to document your work.
* understand the core components of the markdown format.
* be able to use basic markdown syntax to format a document (headers, bold/italics).
* be able to add a code chunk to a `.Rmd` file and add options.
* understand how to modify code chunk options to determine what is/is not rendered in the knitted document.
* know how to `knit` a document to produce an `html` file from an `*.Rmd`.


^[Download the R markdown cheat sheet (here)[https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf].]

The goal of open science and reproducible research is to make scientific methods, data, and results more transparent, available, and reproducible. `R markdown` files are a useful tool to be able to generate reports documenting your data, methods (code used to process data), and results. Key packages allowing you to do this are `knitr` and `rmarkdown`.

`R markdown` (`*.Rmd`) files will let you document your workflow, share how you processed/analyzed your data, the resulting output along with any visualizations. `.Rmd` is a text based file format that consists of standard text, code chunks, and the resulting output unsing a very simple syntax (henc mark*down* as opposed to mark*up* languages like `html` or `LateX` which have much more complicated syntax). When you knit your document, the code is executed and the resulting output with be included in the rendered document (common formats are `html` or `pdf`). Advantages to a workflow centered around using `R markdown` to document your work include:

* the simple syntax makes it easy to learn the basics (but some of the more advance options will let you create some sophisticated reports).
* resulting files have a simple, standardized formatting that looks quite professional and are easy to read and understand (code, documentation, figures all in one place).
* future you will be thankful when you don't have to remember your assumptions, individual steps and modficiations.
* easy modification to extend/refine analysis.


## Create your first .Rmd file

Create a new `.Rmd` file `File -> New File -> R Markdown` and save that file in your project directory as **Lastname_IntroR.Rmd**.

We'll break down the components of the `.Rmd` file in just a second but to give you the full experience hit the `Knit HTML` button to render an `html` document.


## Structure of an Rmarkdown File

An `Rmarkdown`file consists of three components:

1. **Header**: written in `YAML` format the header contains all the information on how to render the `.Rmd` file.
2. **Markdown Sections**: written in (Rmarkdown syntax)[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html].
3. **Code chunks**: Chunks of `R` code. These can be run interactively (e.g. while generating your document) and will be rendered when knitting the document.


## YAML header

The header is written in (YAML syntax)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML], it begins and ends with `---` with four default elements that will determine how the document is knitted.

```

---
title: "title"
author: "name"
date: "Date"
output: html_document
----

```

Customize your `.Rmd`: Change the title and add your name in the author line. Changing the date to `"`r Sys.Date()`"` will automatically include the current date when you render the document. Leave the default output setting.


## Markdown sections

Your markdown sections can contain any text you want using the markdown syntax; once you render the `.Rmd` the resulting (`html`) file will appear as text.

Most of your text (without syntax) will appear as paragraph text but you can add additional syntax to format it in different ways. Check the official documentation for the (basics)[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html].


## Code chunks

Code chunks contain your R code and star and end with three back tick; `{r}` determines that the code chunk should be interpreted as `R` code.

You can add a code chunk using `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I` or `Code -> Insert Chunk`. You can run code chunks line by line using `Ctrl` + `Enter` or you can run the entire chunk by clicking the `Run` button or the little green arrow in the top right corner of an `R` chunk.

Use `#` to comment your code, any lines following a `#` will not be run by R, you can use them to describe what your code is doing.

You can add options to each code chunk to customize how/if a chunk is executed and appears in the rendered output. These options are added to within the curly brackets. The three most common code chunk options are:

* `eval=FALSE`: results in code chunk not being evaluated or run though it will still be rendered in the knitted document.
* `echo=FALSE`: This will hide the code in the output though the generated output will still be rendered for the knitted document.
* `results=hide`: This will result in the cunk being evaluated though neither the results or the code will be rendeded in the knitted document.

Multiple options can be applied to the same chunk; find additional options (here)[http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/output/].


## Render your document using knitr

`knitr` is an `R` package used to render `R markdown` files to another format (usually `html` or `pdf`). In Rstudio the most straightforward way of knitting a document is using the `Knit HTML` button. This will open a new tab in your console title R Markdown that will show the knitting process; any errors that occur with show up here along with a line number so you can determine where the error is occurring in your `.Rmd` file to troubleshoot the issue. The output will automatically be saved in your working directory.


## Some advanced options

^[make sure the path to your image is relative to your `.Rmd` file; e.g create a `images` subdirectory in your project directory.]

You can add images to an `R markdown` as follows:

```

![alt text here](path-to-image-here)

```

You can stylize your rendered document by modifying the `YAML` header to include a table of contents or use a specific theme.
