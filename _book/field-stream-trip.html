<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Introduction</h3>
<p><a href="https://crowdwater.ch/en/">Crowdwater</a> is a Citizen Science project out of the University of Zurich to collect supplemental data to enable improved modeling of floods and droughts.</p>
<p>Citizen Science or volunteer monitoring is scientific research where data collection for specific projects is gathered at least in part by nonprofessional scientists. Frequently, these projects make use of the ubiquitness of smartphones allowing users to gather and upload data using an app. One of the most well-known projects is <code>iNaturalist</code>.</p>
<p>Crowdwater uses a geocaching-type approach where “spots” (measuring stations) can be found using a smart phone app and navigated to using the built-in maps and any user can add additional observations. The generated data can be used to update hydrological models predicting streamflow which have important roles for flood/drought prediction and water management decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="crodwater-app" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Crodwater App</h3>
<p><strong>Download the App</strong><br>
Search for and download the app in the Google Play or Apple App store.</p>
<p><strong>Register an Account &amp; Log in</strong><br>
Open the app and register a <code>SPOTTERON</code> account using an email address. You will choose a username and password. If you get logged out, you need to log in using the email address &amp; password.</p>
<p><strong>App overview</strong><br>
When you open the app it should show you your current location and you will be able to view spots (and stacks of spots) near your location. Top right will show an icon for your user profiles and new notifications. The ribbon on the bottoms has buttons to filter, find the newest entries, stats, and the menu (blue). The black <code>+</code> symbol is for adding new spots.</p>

<p><strong>Check out a spot</strong><br>
If you select a spot you will get detailed information on the type of spot, when it was created, updates, and any comments.</p>
<p><strong>Spot types</strong><br>
There are six types of spots. <code>Virtual Staff Gauges</code> and <code>Physical Staff Gauges</code> are used to measure changes in the water level. <code>Stream Type</code> can be used to give additional information on stream or river being monitored. <code>Temporary Stream</code> and <code>Soil moisture</code> can be used to monitor changes in the appearance (and disappearance) of temporary streams and changes in soil moisture - both are indicative of drought and flood conditions. Finally <code>Plastic Pollution</code> spots can be used to monitor the amount and type of pollution encountered in streams.</p>

Figure 4.3: The six different types of monitoring spots.
</p>
<img src="images/spot_types.jpg" alt="The six different types of monitoring spots. " width="250px">
</div>
<p>We will be monitoring two sites and making three types of measurements: observed changes in water level using <code>Virtual Staff Gauges</code> and changes in drought/flood conditions by monitoring changes in <code>Temporary Streams</code> and <code>Soil moisture</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Staff Gauge</strong><br>
When a new Virtual Staff Gauge is created a staff gauge is superimposed on a picture of your measuring spot, aligned with the water level, and the size adjusted so the water classes can be used to record changes in the water level.</p>
<div class="figure">

Figure 4.4: Detailed information on virtual gauge spot
</p>
<img src="images/Virtual_gauge.jpg" alt="Detailed information on virtual gauge spot" width="250px">
</div>
<p>All new measurements are relative to the initially recorded water level, i.e. you compare an update to the original and determine where the water level is now relative to the original water level and record that water class as +/- . This is frequently easier to do via the webpage compared to the app.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Stream</strong><br>
A temporary stream is a stream that experiences extreme shifts in water level throughout the year and will run dry during certain times even under normal conditions.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:temp-stream"></span>

<p>A temporary stream spot will have a picture of the temporary stream (which might not be visible depending on when it was taken), e.g. arrows might be used to indicate where the stream should be.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>DRY STREAMBED</strong>: no visible water, stream bed is dry</li>
<li>
<strong>WET STREAMBED</strong>: no visible water, stream bed is wet at least 2 cm depth below the surface</li>
<li>
<strong>ISOLATED POOLS</strong>: separated pools of water, no visible flow in the stream bed</li>
<li>
<strong>STANDING WATER</strong>: water but no visible flow</li>
<li>
<strong>TRICKLING WATER</strong>: clearly visibly flowing water, but little flow</li>
<li>
<strong>FLOWING WATER</strong>: continuously flowing water</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Soil moisture</strong><br>
Soil moisture can be an important indicator of drought and flood conditions.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>DRY</strong>: If you left your backpack on the ground, it would still be dry after a long time.</li>
<li>
<strong>GRADUALLY DAMP</strong>: If you left your backpack on the ground, after some time the bottom of your backpack would be damp.</li>
<li>
<strong>GRADUALLY WET</strong>: If you left your backpack on the ground, after some time it would start get wet (items in the backpack would get damp).</li>
<li>
<strong>IMMEDIATELY WET</strong>: If you left your backpack on the ground, your backpack and contents would immediately get wet.</li>
<li>
<strong>MUDDY</strong>: If you were to step on the ground, there would be a squeaky, squishy sound - if you were running and came to a sudden stop, you’d have a wet butt.</li>
<li>
<strong>WELLING</strong>: If you were to step on the ground, water would come out of the ground next to your shoe (yes, if you stomped on the ground, you might get somebody <em>else</em> wet).</li>
<li>
<strong>SUBMERGED</strong>: It’s basically a puddle.</li>
<li>
<strong>RAIN/SNOW</strong>: If the spot is covered in snow or it is currently raining you cannot make an accurate measurement - but still take a picture and update the spot.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update a Spot</strong><br>
To add a new measurement to an existing spot, use the app and the integrated maps to locate that spot and tap the icon (see Figures <a href="field-stream-trip.html#fig:virt-gauge">4.4</a>, <a href="field-stream-trip.html#fig:temp-stream">4.5</a>, <a href="field-stream-trip.html#fig:soil">4.7</a>). Next, either tap on the blue <code>+</code> sign on the map next to the spot, or in the information section about the spot, tap the three vertical dots and select update spot.</p>

</div>
<p>This will open a <code>NEW MEASUREMENT</code> interface that will allow you to take a new picture (or use an existing picture). For a virtual staff gauge you will need to compare the current water level to the original water level to determine the relative change in water classes, for temporary streams and soil moisture identify the original measurement location using the the original image and then add your observation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Website</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://crowdwater.ch/en/">Crowdwater website</a> has additional background information and resources regarding the entire project.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://crowdwater.ch/en/data/">Data</a> section of the website both to explore current spots around the world<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> This is also where you can download the crowdsourced data for analysis</span> and you can use it to add and update spots as well. For virtual staff gauge spots it can be helpful to take pictures in the field and then upload them to your computer to update spots because it will allow you to compare an image on your phone to the computer screen to determine the change in water level. It is also easier to backdate images etc. from the website interface.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Go Forth!</h2>
<p>Now that you are familiar with the app, spot, and measurement types it’s time to make some observations. You will be making these observations on your own time with a field buddy and uploading your observations via the app or the website<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> because you can take images and upload them later we can always do that together if you are unsure!</span>.

<div id="sign-up-for-field-ish-trips" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Sign-up for field-ish trips</h3>
<p><em>You will need the observations you make in the field both through the app and in general for the lab at the end of the semester so be sure to take these field trips seriously and take notes if needed. These outings are considered part of your lab participation grade.</em></p>
<p>Find a field buddy (at least one of you should have a car) and sign up for two trips per site on the google spreadsheets (links will be in our slack channel for easy access throughout the semester). We are trying to make weekly(ish) measurements, but you are free to visit during a time that is convenient for you and your schedule (try to find a buddy with a similar schedule). We will have everyone sign off their measurements as completed with a time/date so you will be able to see when the last measurement was made<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> Ideally, if the person before you went on a Sunday, don’t go Monday even if it is “the next week”</span>.</p>
<p>Site 1 (Piscataquog River Park) is closer to campus (approx. 5 minute drive) and only has three measurement points. You should budget for driving time and at least 30 minutes.<br>
Site 2 (Pulpit Rock Conservation Area) is about a 15 minute drive and involves hiking in about 30 - 45 minutes depending on your walking speed and you need to hike back out to the parking lot at the trail head, though coming back should be quicker since you won’t have to stop to make observations; you should budget at least 90 minutes + driving time.<br>
Ideally, you should visit each sites both early in the semester and in the back half.<br>
Theoretically, you could take a single afternoon and hit both sites but then you would want to budget 3 - 4 hours to make sure you have plenty of time.<br>
You should discuss with your partner whether you want to pack your weeks (i.e. sign up for two weeks in which you commit to going to both locations) or spread them out (i.e. sign up for a different week for each site/visit).<br>
You and your partner should alternate “taking the lead”, i.e. being responsible to upload the observations.</p>

<div id="going-in-the-field" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Going in the field</h3>
<p>Safety is our top priority. Always go with a buddy, be mindful of your surroundings, and keep an eye out for each other<label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> I expect you to be mindful of social distancing protocols - if you can find a field buddy that you already have high interaction that would be great even though time in the field is a great time to get to know a new person!</span>; our second site is more remote and you might loose cell service out there. Wear appropriate clothes and footwear (let’s not have any rolled ankles!), especially for Site 2 the trails will likely be more muddy later in the semester. Use bug spray. Have fun.</p>
<p>Checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>field buddy.</li>
<li>weather appropriate clothes &amp; shoes.</li>
<li>bug spray.</li>
<li>app downloaded/cell phone charged.</li>
<li>water, snacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Safety is our top priority, if conditions do not seem safe (heavy rain, lightning …) during your week please contact me immediately so we can figure out our best options. Do not go hiking on your own - if your field buddy needs to drop out for some reason contact me right away and we will figure something out (Am I always looking for an excuse for some fresh air? Probably.)</em></p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Be observant</h3>
<p>For both locations observe the following and anything else you think is interesting or noteworthy (take notes if needed, we will pick this up at the end of the semester).</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the surrounding of the trails like (urban, rural, busy streets)?</li>
<li>How many people did you encounter during your walk/hike? What activities where they engaging in?</li>
<li>What was the trail like (paved, gravel, …)/how well was it maintained?</li>
<li>Observe the vegetation? What types of trees (old/young)? Are there shrubs, grasses, …? Is it being maintained or left to itself?</li>
<li>Did you see or hear animals?</li>
<li>Compare and contrast your visits early vs later in the semester.</li>

<p>For the orange route you will start on the Rail Trail and keep going past the ice arena (behind the trees to your right) and two baseball diamonds (also hidden by the trees), you will see some stairs to your right that you can take down towards the pitch.</p>

<p>Once you are level with the pitch there is a small path that will take you around and behind the field to a small trail that will take you down to the river, you will hit a T-crossing, take the path to your right to come out by the footbridge and the two measurement points.</p>

<p>Park your vehicle at the Pulpit <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pulpit+Road+Trail-head+Parking/@42.9485262,-71.5874269,15.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x41ab24d525816bf6!8m2!3d42.9471641!4d-71.5940917">Road Trail-head Parking lot</a>.</p>
<p>After you park and access the trail, initially you’ll be following the yellow path (look for markers on the trees). To your right you should see the stream bed of the Pulpit Brook (it is currently running quite dry!).</p>

<p>At this point you can’t really get lost you just have to make sure that you take pictures at all the spots. They should be easy to spot, most of them are next to/under bridges/boardwalks.</p>
<p>Your first spot is about 2-3 minutes down the trail - it is a temporary stream crossing this bridge.</p>

<p>Keep going, you are basically at the last measurement spot (2 - 3 min); soil moisture next to a boardwalk. For the direction you are coming in it will probably look more like this:</p>

<p>The fastest and safest way back is the way you came, follow the white trail and connect with the yellow trail back to your car. This is the recommended way to end your field trip(ish) outing.</p>
<p><em>The Ravine Trail takes you down into the gorge which during certain times of the year and depending on rain fall will be muddy and slippery, some of the signage is also not easy to spot/follow and it’s easy to get a bit lost. Remember, safety is our top priority.</em></p>
