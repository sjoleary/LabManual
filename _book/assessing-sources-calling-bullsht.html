<p><em>The bullshitter is neither on the side of the true or the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all. He does not reject the authority of the truth, as the liar does, and oppose himself to it. He pays no attention to it at all. By virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Misinformation describes erroneous/incorrect information, by contrast disinformation is the deliberate use of false information with an intent to mislead. Finally, propaganda intentionally biased and/or misleading information used with the explicit intention to promote a specific cause or point of view.</p>
<p>In his book <code>On Bullshit</code>, Harry G. Frankfurt distinguishes between a <strong>liar</strong> who knows the truth and deliberately tries to convince somebody of something that is untrue and a <strong>bullshitter</strong> who either does not know the truth or does not care - their focus is solely on persuading the listener. The focus of this distinction is the blatant disregard for truth and a carelessness in how data and facts are used.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Sagan-Baloney.pdf">The Fine Art of Baloney Detection</a>, Carl Sagan outlines nine principles to consider identify and weed out misinformation &amp; disinformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “facts.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among “multiple working hypotheses,” has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others will.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Quantify. If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If there’s a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of them.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle — an electron, say — in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals of this course is to equip you with a framework to be able to categorize and assess new information you encounter, or as Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it <em>“To be scientifically literate is to empower yourself to know when someone else is full of bullshit”</em>. The key term here is <strong>to empower yourself</strong>, i.e. develop a set of skills so that you can pro-actively and habitually assess information. We are going to look at some ways to spot misinformation/disinformation using a toolkit of common sense principles, learning how to dig down to the source of online/newspaper articles, and by seeing through some common visualization techniques that distort the information being presented.</p>

<p><strong>The used cars salesman principle</strong></p>
<p>Simple but powerful, when evaluating a source of information sk yourself four simple questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p><strong>Garbage in/garbage out</strong></p>
<p>With ever larger and more available data sets and increasingly complex analysis it is important to not only consider the output and interpretation of an analysis and the methods used (which are becoming increasingly difficult to understand as a layperson) is only ever as good as the data set used in the first place. Consider the source of the data, sample size, how it was generated, and whether it is a legitimate comparison.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Causation &amp; Correlation</strong></p>
<p>There are two common logical fallacies that can be used to take a relationship of two variables to infer causation - <em>cum hoc ergo propter hoc</em> (with this, therefore because of this, i.e. correlation implies causation) and <em>post hoc ergo proper hoc</em> (after this, therefore because of this, i.e. because something occurred first it must be causing the later).</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-13" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">How many more fancy latin phrases do I have up my sleeve? We shall probably never truly know… Is this an <em>exempli gratia</em> of using fancy language to obfuscate information? Also difficult to tell.</span>
Taking this to <em>ad absurdum</em> we have fun examples involving <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmon1211064">chocolate and Nobel laureates</a> along with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/hrp259/2007/regression/storke.pdf">storks and babies</a>. Both illustrate the fact that it is important to be careful when inferring causation, consider whether proxies are meaningful, whether there could be a common cause rather than correlation, and if there is a way to design manipulative experiments to determine causation. With increasingly large data sets it is easy to find a “signal” in a noisy data set and spin it into a story.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> … by going to the source</h3>
<p>In one of their exhibits, the Pacific Science Center emphasizes four principles for a lay audience to consider when engaging with “science”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Science is meant to move slowly</li>
<li>Change is a natural part of science</li>
<li>Experts have different specialties</li>
<li>Not all sources are trustworthy</li>
</ul>
<p>This is important to keep in mind when watching science unfold in real time and out in the open via social media, pre-prints (before peer-review) and in media outlets. It is important to <a href="http://slow-science.org/">slow down</a> and give science an chance to breath and mature through discussion and testing.</p>

<p>“New studies find …” makes for a great headline, though unfortunately occasionally both deliberately and unintentionally by the time the “new study” is translated into a press release and that press release is written up in the media misinformation or disinformation may have sneaked in.

<ul>
<li>cherry-picking</li>
<li>over-generalizing (see <code># In Mice</code> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inmice?lang=en">examples</a> and an <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/15/in-mice-twitter-account-hype-science-reporting/">article</a> describing the intent behind the hashtag).</li>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> … by not being mislead by visualizations</h3>
<p>Manipulative visualization either present false data or misrepresent data to tell a specific story, i.e. they are either lying with false data or lying with truthful data. A good way to assess a figure is to break it down into content, structure, and presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Questions asked (titles) and legends can be very subjective and manipulate the data.</li>
<li>Check if data is being cherry-picked or if all data points are included.</li>
<li>Consider ’Garbage in/garbage out".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are all data points plotted?</li>
<li>Are all bins/intervals evenly selected?</li>
<li>Are there skewed graph proportions? Do % add up to 100?</li>
<li>Have axes been manipulated?</li>
<li>Is there a combination of thicker/less nuanced lines?</li>
<li>Is color being used to manipulate?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It is alright to decorate construction but never construct decoration.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The presentation for a graph can easily be used for intentional manipulation and misrepresentation of the data. Two types of potentially misleading figures are Ducks and Glass slippers which fall more into the category of Frankfortian BS characterized by a carelessness towards accurately representing the data.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Ducks are named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Duck">Big_Duck</a> a building shaped like a duck built to sell duck and duck eggs.</span></p>
<p>Ducks are figures where the topic of the figure is reflected in the design itself, e.g. the global carbon footprint being shaped like a footprint, whereas a Glass slipper (mis)uses a very specific format meant to visualize a very specific thing (e.g. a periodic table) in an incorrect context that detracts more from the content than adds to it (and sometimes is quite confusing!).</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Assessing quality</h3>
<p>In general, primary literature consists of an Abstract, Introduction, Materials/Methods, Results, Conclusion/Discussion and includes both informative and persuasive elements. When evaluating and discussing primary literature you want to ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the author trying to convince me of?</li>
<li>Were the methods appropriate?</li>
<li>Are they acknowledging potential bias or caveats?</li>
<li>Do I agree with the conclusions?</li>
<li>Is there an alternative explanation for the results?</li>
</ul>
<p>Peer-review does not guarantee that a paper is correct - the intent is to ensure the underlying data set is appropriate to answer the question being asked, methods being used are both reasonable and appropriate, the conclusions follow from the results using sound reasoning, and finally that the paper both accurately represents and adds to the literature.</p>
<p>To establish the legitimacy of a study you can check a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where was the paper published and did it go through peer-review? Is it a legitimate or predatory publisher? Is it in a pre-print archive?</li>
<li>Are the claims commensurate with the journal? Big claims, obscure journal? That should raise some flags!</li>
<li>Has the paper been retracted or seriously questioned? It’s not uncommon to have some controversy including back and forth between papers/comments/letters being published - that is a sharpening of ideas and good for science. Uncovering misconduct leading to retraction is not.</li>
<li>Who are the authors? Do they have a vested interest? Generally the authors affiliations should be listed you can use those to determine if they are established. Even if it is a newcomer (grad students/post-docs are idea generating machines!) they should usually be associated with an established lab.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“False positives and exaggerated results in peer-reviewed scientific studies have reached epidemic proportions in recent years, The problem is rampant in economics, the social sciences and even the natural sciences, but it is particularly egregious in biomedicine”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some ongoing controversy with an increasing number of studies especially in the psychological, medical, and social sciences not being reproducible. There are efforts to require both code and data analysis to be deposited along with the paper for increased accountability to counteract this.</p>
<p>Scientific misconduct including falsification or intentional misrepresentation of data is rare and is frequently uncovered due to irregularities in reproducibility or the data itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Everybody gets so much information all day long that they loose their common sense.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the information overload and misinformation/disinformation being presented (see section above) the internet has now given us a new category of information where advertising &amp; public information blur commercial and information … think of something like <a href="imdb.com">imdb.com</a>, the international movie database which is both a database and also a way to promote actors, movies, etc.</p>
<p>On the internet everybody can publish their ideas, this is both helpful to give voice to people who don’t usually have a platform but it also means it’s increasingly difficult to weed through the noise. Your sources now do not merely include primary and secondary literature, in addition you have informational, news/media outlets, advocacy groups (NGOs, think tanks, …), business/marketing, and personal webpages, along with social media and blogs.</p>
<p>Here is a basic toolkit to evaluate internet resources. This overlaps with many of the principles we have already layed out but focuses specifically on web sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy
<ul>
<li>Is the website reliable?</li>
<li>Were fact checkers/editors involved?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Authority:
<ul>
<li>Who are the authors?</li>
<li>Are they reputable?</li>
<li>What are their affiliations?</li>
<li>What qualifications do they have?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Publishing body/affiliation:
<ul>
<li>Is data being selected/used to form information representative of specific view?</li>
<li>Is data being used to prove a specific point?</li>
<li>Who is providing the information? What is their point of view?</li>
<li>Is somebody/organization sponsoring the website? What is their reputation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Objectivity:
<ul>
<li>Is there bias?</li>
<li>Is there an agenda to sway opinion in a certain direction?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currency:
<ul>
<li>Is the website up-to-date?</li>
<li>What’s the publication date?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Breadth of coverage:
<ul>
<li>Many topics?</li>
<li>Specific focus?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accuracy &amp; Verifiability of details:
<ul>
<li>What is the knowledge of the literature?</li>
<li>Are content/claims placed in context?</li>
<li>Is knowledge of appropriate theories/schools of thought/techniques being displayed?</li>
<li>How was data gathered?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Target audience:
<ul>
<li>What is the audience level?</li>
<li>How broad or narrow is the target audience?</li>
<li>Are the authors “dog whistling” (using specific terms/“code words” to get the attention of specific groups)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

► Question 5.8
</p>
<div class="question-body">
<p>
Here are four links to information about sharks - visit any one of the first three links and the fourth link, make a brief assessment of the two websites using the categories above and argue whether or not you would use the information on that webpage for a presentation on sharks. Remember that an appropriate assessment of the website includes not just the article in the link but poking around the entire website. You do not have to answer each question but you should include an evaluation of each category.
